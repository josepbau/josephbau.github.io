<p>My overall goal for this course and for this degree is to become familiar with using my computer. It's been so long that I forgot how to utilize some of the most simplest functions.  Along with familiarizing myself, I also want to learn how to apply what I'm learning in my current position. I absolutely love the fact that we are able to put into practice what we are learning and creating an end product.</p>
    
<p>My second goal is to grasp the concept and the different formats we are learning and not only apply them but to also recognize them in my day to day operations at work as I skim through loads of data and queries.  We also have the ability to generate and create queries along with knowledge base records to furnish on our company resource page. I would like to contribute to this page and publish my findings in efforts to assist others with certain fix actions and helpful articles.</p>
